- Chapter 1 (C++ Basics) from [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) can be used as a general reference for what we have covered, although the content might not align exactly.
- More about compiled versus interpreted languages: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/


# Week of 01-29
- From chapter 4 (Fundamental Data Types) of [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/), Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 
and from chapter 6 (Operators) - Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.7.
- We wrote a [shell script](./01-31/compandrun.sh) to automate our compiling and running of C++ programs. Some resources:
    + See [here](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/shell-script) for what a shell script is
    + See [here](https://www.shellscript.sh/first.html#home) for a basic shell script
    + See [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/read-command-line-arguments-in-shell-scripts) for giving arguments from the terminal to the shell script.
    + I used the `chmod` command to change the script permission so we could execute it. `chmod` isn't complicated but it usually takes time to explain it. See [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/8/linux-chmod-command) if you want to understand how it works.
