# Problem 3
The following program code should print `Hello, Buggy World` on to the screen. However, it doesn't
compile because of a bug. 
```
include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello Buggy World\n";
    return 0;
}
```
Copy the code into a file called `prob3.cpp`, fix the bug, and submit your
corrected version of the code.
