# Problem 8
In the previous problem notice that even in cases where the user enters an invalid choice, the application asks for the two numbers. Change this behavior in a program called `prob8.cpp`. In other words, `prob8.cpp` works exactly as `prob7.cpp` except in cases where
the user enters an invalid choice (an integer other than `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`). In such cases, it will not ask the user to enter values for `x` and `y`.
For example:
```
Integer Calculator

Choose from the following menu:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

What is your choice? 0

Invalid choice!
