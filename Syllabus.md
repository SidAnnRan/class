## Grading
The course grade will be determined based on performance on homework assignments, quizzes, surveys, and a final project 

The following table represents the grade mapping that will be used: 
| Grade | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| A+ | >= 98% |
| A  | >= 94% |
| A- | >= 90% |
| B+ | >= 88% |
| B  | >= 84% |
| B- | >= 80% |
| C+ | >= 78% |
| C  | >= 74% |
| C- | >= 70% |
| D+ | >= 68% |
| D  | >= 64% |
| D- | >= 60% |
| F  | < 60%  |

All of the graded components will be measured in points. Contributions to the grade are summarized as follows:

| Evaluation | Percentage |
|------------|------------|
| Quizzes    | 20% |
| Homeworks  | 50% |
| Project    | 30% |

## Assignments
### Quizzes
Instructions for in-class quizzes or surveys will be given on-the-fly, in class. There will be upto one quiz/survey per class.

### Homeworks
Homework problem specifications will be shared through Github, and submissions will be through ICON (we may switch to submissions 
via Github later in the semester). There will be 8-10 homeworks over the course of the semester.

### Project 
Project will be specified through Github, and submission will either be through Github or ICON (TBD). Project will be specified 
after Spring Break and due in finals week.

### Late Submissions
Assigned work must be completed by the designated due dates. This is done to ensure the integrity of the grading and fairness 
to the rest of the class. Any assignments not submitted at the assigned time will be considered late, and will be subject to a penalty of a 25% reduction in total points for every 24-hour period they are late. Reach out to the instructor (not the TA)
for exceptional circumstances before the deadline.

## Tentative Calendar
The following calendar is only to provide some structure, things will change depending on student
feedback. For example, getting used to the tools might take more class time during the semester,
and if students show enough interest, we might spend more time on some tool features.

## Academic Misconduct
All students in CLAS courses are expected to abide by the [CLAS Code of Academic Honesty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code). Undergraduate academic misconduct must be reported by instructors to CLAS according to [these](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/undergraduate-teaching-policies-resources/academic-misconduct) procedures.

Unless mentioned otherwise, all assignments (quizzes, homeworks, projects, etc.) must be done
individually​ . You may consult online resources to 
help your understanding of the project
goals but  copy-and-pasting of code is not acceptable​.
Students can talk to each other about concepts and ideas 
that relate to the class. However, it is important to ensure that these discussions do not lead to the actual
exchange of solutions, especially written material.

## Mental Health Resources and Student Support
Students are encouraged to be mindful of their mental health and seek help as a preventive measure or if feeling overwhelmed and/or struggling to meet course expectations. Students are encouraged to talk to their instructor for assistance with specific class-related concerns. For additional support and counseling, students are encouraged to contact University Counseling Service (UCS). Information about UCS, including resources and how to schedule an appointment, can be found at counseling.uiowa.edu. Find out more about UI mental health services at mentalhealth.uiowa.edu.
