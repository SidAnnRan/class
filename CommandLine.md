# Command-Line Cheatsheet
Useful commands for navigating the Linux OS through the command-line:
1. `pwd` or "print working directory" prints the full path of the current directory of the terminal.
2. `cd <directory>` lets you "change directory" to `<directory>` directory. Two noteworthy shortcuts for directory paths: `.` refers to the current directory and `..` refers to the parent directory.
3. `ls` "lists" the directories and files contained within the current directory.
4. `mkdir <directory>` creates directory `<directory>` within the current directory.
5. `rm <file>` removes the argument file.
6. `rm -r <directory>` remvoves the argument directory, 
where `-r` is an *option* that modifies the behavior of the `rm` command to work on directories.
